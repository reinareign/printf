# _printf

The ALX C - printf group project is a collaboration completed by Chisom Enem and Awam Chimere as part of the low-level
programming and algorithm learning at the renowned ALX Holberton School. This program is a pseudo -
recreation of the C standard lib function, 'printf.'

# Usage

Compile all '.c' files in the repository, incorporating the header 'main.h' into the main function, to utilize the '_printf' function, assuming that the necessary dependencies have been installed.

# Description

The function '_printf' outputs data to the standard output based on a 'format' string, which guides the conversion of subsequent arguments using the variable-length argument facilities of 'stdarg'.
